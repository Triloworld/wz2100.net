Spectators can: Watch a multiplayer game live* See the entire map Chat with other spectators (but not with players) Use the special specstats chat command to open a special statistics view Re-watch a locally-saved replay of the game later *Note: The game does not wait on spectators, once started, so if a spectator’s connection to the host is poor they may have a sub-par live viewing experience.</description></item><item><title>Version 4.0.0-beta3 available</title><link>https://wz2100.net/it/news/version-4-0-0-beta3/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://wz2100.net/it/news/version-4-0-0-beta3/</guid><description>The third beta release of 4.0.0, 4.0.0-beta3, is available for testing, with many bug fixes since beta1 &amp;amp; beta2.
